hand-sewn plush forest animal characters,
visible stitching and fabric seams,
soft felt and fleece textures,
embroidered eyes, button noses,
storybook plush illustration style,
warm diffused bedtime lighting,
cozy children’s book aesthetic,
shallow depth of field,
cinematic but gentle,
no realism, no plastic
